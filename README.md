# CSS Selector Fun!

## Instructions ðŸ˜¸

This web page consists of two important files: `index.html` and `styles/style.css`. It is currently completely unstyled, but the CSS file is full of comments detailing what styles we want to see.

Your job is to go through `styles.css` comment by comment, and add CSS code to achieve the desired effect.

This assignment should be completed using **only CSS**. None of the styles require any changes to the HTML, though some may take some clever selector work to achieve. **DO NOT** change anything in the HTML file.
